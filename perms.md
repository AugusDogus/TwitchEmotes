## Missing Permissions
If whenever you try to use the `addemotes` command and it says you need to give the bot permissions, this is how:

*Only users with the manage roles permission can do the following*

First, click the corrosponding referral link for your device:

<a href="#desktop">Desktop</a>

<a href="#iphone">iPhone</a>

<a href="#android">Android</a>


### Desktop
First click the dropdown in the top right

Now click the roles tab

![roles tab](./assets/desktop/settings.png)

Find the `BTTV Emotes` role and click on it

![bttv emotes roles tab](./assets/desktop/roles.png)

Finally, scroll to the `Manage Emojis` role and check it green

![emojis tab](./assets/desktop/emojis.png)

Now the command should work! If you still have this problem, [create an issue](https://github.com/MrAuro/OuraEmotes/issues/new/choose)
